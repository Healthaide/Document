market, the content in the input field with password shows implicitly to user. Besides, the initial main style of color is green after 
discussed with teammates due to green color gives individuals a feeling of peace and comfortable that may attract more users to use our app. our

Registration interface

  2) Navigation bar
  3) Content

The Status bar includes network signal, battery situation, current time......
  
The Navigation bar has a page title called "registration" and a return key.

The content are consisted of six subparts:
  1) a label named "phone number" followed by an input text with hints "please input correct phone number"
  2) a label named "verified code" followed by an input text with hints "please input code you received". a button named "Acquire" is on the most

  4) a label named "Confirm" followed by an input text with hints "please enter password again"
  5) a check box followed by a text "I agree with user protol"
  6) a button named "Register Now"

Considering the security of our application and efficiency of the system, my team decide to take phone number as users' account number. Besides,
in order to better manage the system, our team also need to verify the certification of phone number that users submit to registration via sending 
a verified code by phone number. What is more, to inform users better understand and use our system, our team provide user protol for them.

Based on above evaluations, there is an initial mockup for registration interface designed by balsamiq mockup, and see Register.pdf.
