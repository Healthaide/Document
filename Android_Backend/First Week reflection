I am Demo Xu, I am responsible for the android back-end technology in this R&D project. In this week, I experienced a face to face discussion with Bill and Wade. Firstly, I imported the android back-end project in Myeclispse of my laptop. This project is a demo that could demonstrate the basic function of an android project with simple user interfaces. Then, I installed the android studio into my laptop. And I imported this demo and configured it with the help of Bill and Wade. Then, I could test the android project in my HUAWEI mobile phone. Then I checked the sql connection code of this demo and learnt how to connect the database in an android project. Furthermore, I checked the method of data transmission of this demo, it uses the json to exchange data between android front and android-back end. What’s more, I also wrote the system’s requirement of Web system. Then, I configured the mysql with my Myeslispese in my laptop with bill and wade at that time. What’s more, I checked the knowledge related to MVC model in the android back-end. Because I am family with the MVC model in the WEB system, thus I have to check the knowledge in the android back-end system. Meanwhile, I need to watch some educating videos of programming in android back-end.
