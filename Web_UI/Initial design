   2) Time
   3) Category 
At the end of each line there are two buttons called "Delete" and "Check". Managers can browse the whole list and they also can skip to the beginning page or end page.

Since the content of most article is abbreviated, manager can click "Check" to get more details.

When manager need to delete some articles, they will be informed whether the operation is successful. The messsage will be "Delete Successfully!" or "Please try again!"
