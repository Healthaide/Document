This week i was busy in helping my parent's business since some employees have already came home to preper the Spring Festival and my parent were lack of assistants to record orders and inventory, however my family still needed to wake up early especially my father who always got up at 4 o'clock and come home late at about 9 o'clock, so i was so sorry not to complete my last week's goal--- finishing all codes in web UI design. Actually, i only have done the forth function---Doctor management. 

Next week is the Chinese New year, to be honest, i am not sure how much i can do for my R&D project as i will go back to my hometown and celebrate the festival with my big family, and at that time i will also be busy in various parties, family meals and visitings. The only thing i can promise is that i will use my free time to do as much programmming as i can and i will not give up watching relevant UI videos.
